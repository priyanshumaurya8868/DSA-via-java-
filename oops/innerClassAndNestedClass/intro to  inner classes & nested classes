Java Inner Classes
Java inner class or nested class is a class which is declared inside the class or interface.

We use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place so that it can be more readable and maintainable.

Additionally, it can access all the members of outer class including private data members and methods.

Syntax of Inner class
class Java_Outer_class{  
 //code  
 class Java_Inner_class{  
  //code  
 }  
}
Adavantage :- 

1. access all the members of outer class
2. to develop more readable and maintainable code.
3. code optimization : it required less code to write

Difference between nested class and inner class in Java...
Inner class is a part of nested class. Non-static nested classes are known as inner classes.

Types of Nested classes
There are two types of nested classes non-static and static nested classes.The non-static nested classes are also known as inner classes.

1. Non-static nested class (inner class)
1(a). Member inner class
1(b).Anonymous inner class
1(c).Local inner class

2. Static nested class
